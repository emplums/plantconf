          Habitat & Gardening Practices to Support Honeybee Health
        </div>
        <div class='speaker'>

          Honeybees and other pollinators are vital to ecosystem health, yet have been in decline over the last decade mostly due to habitat fragmentation and flaws within modern beekeeping practices. The best way to increase honeybee vitality is to create proper habitat and to have more backyard beekeepers interested in a 'hands off bee-centric' approach that supports the well being of the bees. By creating a safe space for bees we are not only increasing the productivity of our gardens, but also helping to conserve these creatures that so deeply need our assistance at this time. This talk will give a brief background around the issues bees face today, some gardening practices to support honeybee health, as well as some information around bee stewardship and natural hive options that require little to no intervention following installation.
